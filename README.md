# Cotton Bounce
A simple Lua script for OBS that applies a simple transformation to a source, making it "bounce" up and down, and rotate ever so slightly on it's axis.

## Installation
Download the latest release, and add to OBS via the scripts menu (located under "Tools"). Once installed, edit the on-screen settings to your liking, ensuring that you enter the exact spelling of your source in your scene under "_Source name_".
